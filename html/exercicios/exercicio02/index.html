        elixirs, teas, and coffees, or, stay a bit longer and enjoy the multicultural culinary menu that combines a harmony of
        taste, texture, and color with the best in fresh and healthy ingredients.</p>

        adding an extra dimension to your dining experience. The decor surrounds you with the relaxing sentiments of sights
        from eras past. And, don't forget, the lounge offers free wireless access to the Internet, so bring your laptop.</p>
        
        <p>Our guarantee: at the lounge, we're committed to providing you, our guest, with an exceptional experience every time
        you visit. Wheter you're just stopping by to check in on email over an elixir, or are here for an out-of-the-ordinary

        beats across our spacious tiki-themed dance floor. Or just hang out in one of our comfy white vinyl booths at the
        dance bar. You can have your elixirs delivered from the main lounge right to the dance floor. If you've had enough of
        the beat, just head back to the lounge area to relax. And, no matter where you find yourself in the lounge, you'll
